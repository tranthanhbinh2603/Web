Chicken The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
(Gallus gallus). They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
billion as of 2018[1], up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird
or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and,
less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food
until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).
